    "Title: Converting Solr Queries from NASA ADS Usage into Natural Language Requests for a Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: The user provides Solr queries typically used on the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) to search for academic papers. The AI is tasked with interpreting these queries and reformulating them into natural language as if the user were asking a chatbot to perform the search instead. This requires an understanding of both the specific syntax of Solr queries and the more general, conversational tone users employ with chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "**User Input:**\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "title:\"Large Magellanic Cloud\" AND year:2023 AND author:\"^Smith, J\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Output:**\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Can you find papers from 2023 titled \"Large Magellanic Cloud\" with an author whose name starts with \"Smith, J\"?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "**User Input:**\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "abstract:\"exoplanets\" AND body:\"habitable zones\" AND year:[2018 TO 2023]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Output:**\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Could you search for papers between the years 2018 and 2023 that mention \"exoplanets\" in the abstract and discuss \"habitable zones\" in the main text?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3:\n",
    "**User Input:**\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "author:\"Doe, John\" AND keyword:\"black holes\" AND property:refereed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Output:**\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Can you find refereed publications by the author \"Doe, John\" that have keywords related to \"black holes\"?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "1. Analyze the structure of the Solr query delimited by triple backticks to understand what the user is searching for. Pay attention to specific fields such as title, author, year, keywords, properties of the paper, etc.\n",
    "2. Transform the technical query into a conversational format, as if asking a chatbot to perform the search. Ensure the request is casual and natural-sounding, similar to how people speak in everyday conversation.\n",
    "3. Maintain all critical information from the original query in the conversational request. Do not add or infer any details not explicitly mentioned in the initial query.\n",
    "4. Use clear and straightforward language, avoiding jargon or technical terminology unfamiliar to the average person.\n",
    "5. Be polite in your conversational request, as users typically are when interacting with a service-oriented chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Things to Avoid:**\n",
    "- Do not generate responses that are overly technical or contain jargon that the user may not understand.\n",
    "- Avoid changing any specific details from the original query; the integrity of the search parameters must remain intact.\n",
    "- Do not add filler or fluff to the conversational request. Keep it direct and to the point, though friendly and natural.\n",
    "- Refrain from asking the user follow-up questions in the output; the task is to translate the query, not to continue the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "query: ```{query}```\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "ts_5 = '''\n",
    "Given a specific solr query used in the NASA ADS system, transform and rephrase it into more natural, conversational language as if the user were asking a chatbot to perform the academic paper search for them. The AI should convert the original solr query, ensuring it sounds human-like and direct, as if one friend were asking another for a favor, while still preserving the exact intent and specificity of the original request. The transformation should consider casual phrasing, contractions, and common colloquialisms to ensure the request is friendly and relatable.\n",
    "The solr query to rephrase is delimited by backticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide examples of solr queries and how they would be rephrased into casual chatbot requests. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solr Query: \"author:('Hawking, S.') AND title:('Black Holes')\"\n",
    "   Chatbot Request: \"Can you find any of Stephen Hawking's papers with 'Black Holes' in the title?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Solr Query: \"pubdate:[2020-01 TO 2020-12] AND keyword:('Exoplanets')\"\n",
    "   Chatbot Request: \"I'm looking for papers about exoplanets published in 2020.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples should illustrate the transformation from formal technical queries into relaxed, everyday language, making sure the specific search criteria are communicated in a friendly, approachable manner. The chatbot request should sound like one human asking another for help, rather than a user interacting with a system.\n",

    "The AI is an expert database search engineer. Specifically, the AI is trained to create interpret queries that are submitted to NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), a digital library portal for researchers in astronomy and physics. The ADS system accepts queries using the Apache Solr search syntax. The AI predicts how a human user of the ADS system would express their structured query in natural language.\n",
